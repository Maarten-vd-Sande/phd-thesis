\section{Introduction}

\section{Methods}

To generate a collection of putative enhancer regions, we collected all transcription factor ChIP-seq peaks from ReMap 2018 (\href{http://remap.univ-amu.fr/storage/remap2018/hg38/MACS/remap2018_all_macs2_hg38_v1_2.bed.gz}{http://remap.univ-amu.fr/storage/remap2018/hg38/MACS/remap2018\_all\_macs2\_hg38\_v1\_2.bed.gz}) (\href{javascript:;}{41}). We took the summit of all peaks and extended these 25 bp up- and downstream. Based on this file, we generated a coverage bedGraph using bedtools genomecov (\href{javascript:;}{78}). We performed peak calling on this bedGraph file using bdgpeakcall from MACS2 (version v2.7.1) (\href{javascript:;}{69}), with the following settings: \textit{l} = 50 and \textit{g} = 10. We performed the peak calling twice, setting \textit{c} to 4 and 30, respectively. All peaks from \textit{c} = 30 were combined with all peaks of \textit{c} = 4 that did not overlap with the peaks of \textit{c} = 30. We then removed all regions on chrM and extended the summit of the peaks 100 bp up- and downstream to generate a final collection of 1 268 775 putative enhancers of 200 bp. This collection of enhancers is available at Zenodo with doi 10.5281/zenodo.4066423.
