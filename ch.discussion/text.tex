\section{The (molecular) phylotypic stage}

All models are wrong, but some are useful.

\section{scepia: gene regulatory networks}

Almost all gene regulatory approaches are context specific. But in the end a single set of instructions (DNA) for all contexts.

\section{The future of biology}

\subsection{Computational}

\subsection{lack of unified data encode like stuff}

For seq2science paper we tried paper X, Y, Z. DIFFICULT to get similar results.     

% No similarity between replicates:
% https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12687-4
% 
%  drosophila sample missing and two other samples swapped

\subsection{Open Science}

\subsection{Too much descriptive, not enough understanding}

\subsection{Move away from mRNA}

mRNA and protein relation

cool work of michael levine on xenobots

\subsection{Stop blaming "the incentives"}

incentives: https://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2018/10/02/no-its-not-the-incentives-its-you/

\subsection{Self-correcting}

e.g. wild growth covid papers

papers keep on being cited after retraction

% Biology is messy, but that does not mean computational biology has to be.
