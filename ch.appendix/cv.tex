\section{Curriculum Vitae}

Maarten van der Sande was born on August 13\textsuperscript{th} 1993, in the municipality of Renkum, the Netherlands. After completing his secondary education at the Dorenweerd College, he started his bachelor's at the Universiteit van Amsterdam. Here, he simultaneously obtained two bachelor's degrees, one in Biology, and one in Liberal Arts and Sciences. Maarten, however, spent most of his time doing extracurricular activities such as competitive rowing, race biking, fencing, and finding his way home after a party. He finished his studies with a master's degree in Computational Science, a joint program of the Universiteit van Amsterdam and the Vrije Universiteit. At this time Maarten developed a healthy aversion to busy work, like writing a Curriculum Vitae section for a PhD thesis. After his studies in Amsterdam, Maarten went on to get a PhD degree at the Radboud Universiteit. Here, under the wings of Simon van Heeringen, Maarten studied the computational analysis of transcription regulation during (evolutionary) development. Concurrently, Maarten conducted aerodynamic field tests between Nijmegen and Wageningen, and concluded that he is particularly accident prone. In December 2023, Maarten started a new job as a bioinformatician at Solynta, the world's most innovative potato breeding company.
