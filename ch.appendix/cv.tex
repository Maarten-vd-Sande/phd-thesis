\section{Curriculum Vitae}

Maarten van der Sande was born on August 13\textsuperscript{th} 1993, in the municipality of Renkum, the Netherlands. After completing his secondary education at Dorenweerd College, he started his bachelor's at the Universiteit van Amsterdam. Here, he simultaneously obtained two bachelor's degrees, one in Biology, and one in Liberal Arts and Sciences. Maarten, however, spent most of his time doing extracurricular activities such as competitive rowing, race biking, fencing, and finding his way home after a party. He finished his studies with a master's degree in Computational Science, a joint program of the Universiteit van Amsterdam and the Vrije Universiteit. At this time Maarten developed a healthy aversion to busy work, like writing Curriculum Vitae sections for PhD theses. After his studies in Amsterdam, Maarten went on to get a PhD degree at the Radboud Universiteit. Here, under the supervision of Simon van Heeringen, Maarten studied the computational analysis of transcription regulation during (evolutionary) development. During this time, Maarten also conducted aerodynamic field tests between Nijmegen and Wageningen, and concluded that he is particularly accident-prone. In December 2023, Maarten started a new job as a bioinformatician at Solynta, the world's most innovative potato breeding company.
