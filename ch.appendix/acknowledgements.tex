While I like to pretend it was all a solo project, it is clear that I would not have been able to undertake this project without the help and support of many people.

\bigbreak \noindent
First and foremost, I would like to thank my daily supervisor, \textbf{Simon}. Simon, thank you for providing a space where I could freely research whatever I wanted, and where you always took the time and effort to help me. Moreover, something I never expressed before, but for which I sincerely want to thank you is for staying on as my supervisor and spending your Friday mornings with me even though you got another job. In a similar spirit, I would like to thank my promoter, \textbf{Gert Jan}, for his invaluable guidance and insights throughout this journey.

\bigbreak \noindent
Next, I would like to highlight my colleague and friend, \textbf{Rebecca}. Whilst we had lots of fun together working on several projects, the real fun happened mainly in our many extended coffee breaks, where we discussed a wide variety of topics such as load-bearing walls, ideal coffee-machine settings, video games, board games, and COLLABORATION! Siebren, we started this journey together, and TODO.

\bigbreak \noindent
Then a special shoutout to my close bioinformatics colleagues. First, all my different deskmates over the years, \textbf{Quan}, \textbf{Tilman}, and \textbf{Sybren}. You have patiently suffered my sighs and moans during the day and were always in for a nice chat. \textbf{Jos} and \textbf{Janou} for TODO. Finally, “my” students \textbf{Marlien}, \textbf{Okan}, \textbf{Emma}, \textbf{Jules}, and \textbf{Justin}, for helping me with my projects, but most of all for the fun of having you around. 

\bigbreak \noindent
Big thanks to my friends from Amsterdam \textbf{Mart}, \textbf{Sjoerd}, \textbf{Jonas}, \textbf{Elias}, \textbf{Vincent}, and \textbf{Jim} for patiently listening to my ramblings and complaints about the PhD over the years. Your support and the escapades we shared have been crucial in keeping me grounded and focused.

\bigbreak \noindent
I want to thank my new colleagues at \textbf{Solynta} for the warm welcome and the encouraging environment to finish my PhD you've provided. 

\bigbreak \noindent
I want to thank my parents, \textbf{Rob} and \textbf{Janine}, for their curious questions during my doctoral studies such as “why haven't you finished yet?” and “what's taking so long?”. Jokes aside, your support during  

\bigbreak \noindent
Lastly, to \textbf{Magda}, for loving me.
