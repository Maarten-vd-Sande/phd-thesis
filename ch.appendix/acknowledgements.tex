\section{Acknowledgements}

\noindent
While I like to pretend it was all a solo project, it is clear that I would not have been able to undertake this project without the help and support of many people.

\bigbreak \noindent
First and foremost, I would like to thank my daily supervisor, \textbf{Simon}. Simon, thank you for providing a space where I could freely research whatever I wanted, and where you always took the time and effort to help me. Moreover, something I never expressed, but I sincerely want to thank you is for staying on as my supervisor and spending your Friday mornings with me even though you got another job. In a similar spirit, I would like to thank my promoter, \textbf{Gert Jan}, for his guidance and insights throughout this process.

\bigbreak \noindent
Next, I would like to thank all my close bioinformatics colleagues. First, my buddies \textbf{Rebecca} and \textbf{Siebren}, with whom I spent the whole time in Leuven intoxicated. Rebecca, thanks for sharing your many extended coffee breaks with me, where we discussed a wide variety of topics such as load-bearing walls, ideal coffee-machine settings, and !`collaborash\'ion! And Siebren, for our fun venting sessions when everyone else left the office. Next, a shoutout to my different deskmates over the years, \textbf{Quan}, \textbf{Tilman}, and \textbf{Sybren}, who have patiently suffered my sighs and moans during the day and were always in for a nice chat. Up next are \textbf{Jos} and \textbf{Janou} for your optimism and positivity. Finally, \say{my} students \textbf{Marlien}, \textbf{Okan}, \textbf{Emma}, \textbf{Jules}, and \textbf{Justin}, for helping me with my projects, but most of all for the fun of having you around. 

\bigbreak \noindent
Big-up to my close friends \textbf{Mart}, \textbf{Sjoerd}, \textbf{Jonas}, \textbf{Elias}, \textbf{Vincent}, and \textbf{Jim} for sympathizing and pretending to understand my ramblings about my PhD over the years. 

\bigbreak \noindent
Many thanks to \textbf{Josephine} for her delicious curries, keeping me well-fed during the process. Thanks to my hairy friends \textbf{Guusje}, \textbf{Puk}, \textbf{Sam}, \textbf{Nuno}, \textbf{Paco}, \textbf{Ginkgo}, and \textbf{Barry} for their scratches and licks. Thanks to my new colleagues at \textbf{Solynta} for the warm welcome and encouraging environment you have provided to finish my PhD. 

\bigbreak \noindent
I want to thank my parents, \textbf{Rob} and \textbf{Janine}, for their curious questions during my doctoral studies such as \say{why haven't you finished yet?} and \say{what's taking so long?}. Jokes aside, I appreciate the freedom and support you have provided in always letting me make my own decisions.

\bigbreak \noindent
Lastly, to \textbf{Magda}, for your help and support, but most of all, for loving me.
