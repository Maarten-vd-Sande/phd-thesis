\section{The central dogma of molecular biology}

The human body is formed by a collection of 37,000,000,000,000 cells\cite{Bianconi2013}, with each cell containing approximately 2 meters of DNA. This means that our bodies house an astounding 74,000,000,000 kilometers of DNA, which is equivalent to almost 250 round trips to the sun! Our DNA is organized into 20,000 genes, spread across 23 distinct structures called chromosomes. What makes all this even more intriguing is that all cells within our body possess exactly the same DNA, yet they exhibit remarkable diversity and specialization. How does this single set of instructions give rise to such diverse cell types? What is the role of DNA during (embryonic) development? And how does this process compare across different species? To better appreciate these fascinating phenomena, it is crucial to understand the central dogma of molecular biology (fig. \ref{fig:central_dogma}).

    \label{fig:central_dogma}
\end{figure}

The central dogma of molecular biology describes the flow of genetic information within a biological system. Whereas in a computer information is stored in bits, which can be either zero (0) or one (1), genetic information is stored in nucleotides, which can be either adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or thymine (T). DNA, which stands for deoxyribonucleic acid, is composed of two large strands of these nucleotides that together form a double helix. Both strands contain the same information, but where there is a nucleotide A on one strand, there is always a corresponding nucleotide T on the other, and similarly for C and G. RNA, on the other hand, is a similar molecule but is typically single-stranded. It is transcribed from DNA and shares a similar nucleotide composition but replaces thymine (T) with uracil (U). RNA serves as the bridge between DNA and proteins. Through the process of translation, the information encoded in RNA is decoded and used to assemble chains of amino acids, ultimately resulting in the synthesis of proteins. Proteins carry out various tasks in our bodies, such as enabling chemical reactions, transporting other molecules, providing structure, and acting as regulators of transcription and translation of genes.

Far from all the DNA is transcribed into RNA, and not even all RNA translates to protein. As a general rule of thumb, we distinguish DNA sequences that get transcribed into RNA as genes. The human genome consists of approximately 20.000 genes, and the coding parts of these genes represent approximately 6\% of the genome\cite{Piovesan2019}. Early molecular biologists mainly focused on coding genes, thus the remaining 94\% got known as ``junk DNA''. We now know, however, that at least 80\% of human DNA is involved in at least one biochemical function\cite{encode2012}. Almost all of these functions are related to gene expression regulation.

\section{Gene expression regulation}

A skin cell makes use of a completely different set of genes than a liver cell, even though they contain the same DNA. This is possible due to the tight regulation of gene expression by these cells. To regulate their gene expression cells have a wide array of tools at their disposal. 

\subsection{Transcription Factors}

At the start of each gene sits a promoter (fig. \ref{fig:TF}A). At the promoter general transcription factors bind, which in turn recruit RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). RNAPII is the protein complex responsible for transription, and in turn 

Before DNA transcription can occur, 

DNA transcription requires a wide array of steps. Slightly upstream of a gene is a promoter. To this piece of DNA proteins bind that initiate transcription.

\subsection{Gene regulatory networks}

Mapping the relationship between genes is crucial for understanding how cellular processes are regulated. A common abstraction to understand gene-gene interactions are gene regulatory networks.  

The first gene regulatory network was proposed by Roy Britten and Eric Davidson in 1969\cite{Britten_1969}. They observed that a biological system (i) responds to an external signal; (ii) then produces its own signal as a response; (iii) transmits its own signal to receptors that do not perceive the external signal; (iv) then respond to its own signal, and finally (v) produces a protein as a response. Without modern knowledge of gene regulation, they then correctly reverse-engineered what the minimum requirements are for such a system. One of the things they then predicted was the existence of transcription factors and promoter sequences. It took Eric Davidson more than 30 years to experimentally validate his original work\cite{Davidson_2002}.

Gene regulatory networks are often modeled and visualized with direct gene-gene interactions (fig. \ref{fig:network}A). This means for instance that the protein product of gene $\alpha$ directly regulates the protein product of gene $\beta$, ignoring all steps in between. Even though this is a gross oversimplification of gene-gene interactions, these simple models can already exhibit complex behavior. One of the older and well-known examples of this complex behavior are Turing patterns, discovered by the famous computer scientist Alan Turing\cite{Turing1952}. We consider a system of two genes, gene $\alpha$ and gene $\beta$, where gene $\alpha$ upregulates itself and gene $\beta$, but gene $\beta$ inhibits gene $\alpha$ (fig. \ref{fig:network}B). When modeling this simple two-gene network in a spatial setting it produces complex patterns (fig. \ref{fig:network}C), of which similar patterns can be observed in nature (fig. \ref{fig:network}D).
