\subsection{Computational}

\subsection{lack of unified data encode like stuff}

For seq2science paper we tried paper X, Y, Z. DIFFICULT to get similar results. WHAT da fuck?

% No similarity between replicates:

\subsection{Open Science}

\subsection{Too much descriptive, not enough understanding}

\subsection{Move away from mRNA}

mRNA and protein relation

\subsection{Stop blaming "the incentives"}

incentives: https://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2018/10/02/no-its-not-the-incentives-its-you/

\subsection{Self-correcting}

e.g. wild growth covid papers

papers keep on being cited after retraction

% Biology is messy, but that does not mean computational biology has to be.
